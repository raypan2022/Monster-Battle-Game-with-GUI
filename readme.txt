Things to know before starting the game:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - This is a two-person game! So get a buddy and get playing!

    - In this game, each player will receive a Monster to use for battling! Your objective is to lower your opponent's
      Monster's HP to zero! Each player will take turns commanding their Monsters to attack the other player's Monster.

    - You get to choose what type you want your Monster to have! Fire, Grass, Normal, or Ghost!

    - Different types of Monsters have different effect inducing attacks. For example:
        - Fire type Monsters have the BURN attack (deals chip damage for the next 4 rounds)
        - Grass type Monsters have the POISON attack (deals chip damage for the next 4 rounds)
        - Normal type Monsters have the CONFUSION attack (enemy will sometimes accidentally hit itself for the next 4
          rounds)
        - Ghost type Monsters have the SLEEP attack (has a chance of making the enemy fall asleep and miss turns)

    - Type effectiveness:
        ghost > fire,
        fire > grass,
        grass > ghost,
        normal = fire, grass, or ghost

    - Monsters can regenerate health by using potions. Each player gets 3 potions only. There are no ways to regenerate
      your Monster's stamina, so choose your moves carefully...

    - If both Monsters don't have enough stamina to perform any of their attacks, the game will be a tie.
